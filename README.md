## Tech Used:

• CSS
• Vanilla JavaScript

## Features:
• Generate strong random passwords
• Adjustable password length slider
• Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers & symbols
• Fisher-Yates shuffle for better randomness
• One-click copy to clipboard

## What I Learned:
• DOM manipulation & event handling
• Randomization logic in JavaScript
• Clipboard API (async/await)
• Writing reusable helper functions
• Responsive UI design with Flexbox & media queries

## Next Improvements:
